We appreciate any contribution to Retroflect!

To contribute feedback, please open a GitHub issue.

To contribute a specific feature or bugfix, please open a PR. Before submitting your PR, we ask you to run the Elixir
tests, lint, and formatting tools we use on the project. If you have a contribution to make but don't know how to run
the tools below, go ahead and open it and we will help you. For larger changes, open an issue first so that we can have
a discussion before you put a lot of work into a PR.

To run the tests and formatting tools:

```
$ mix deps.get
$ mix test
$ mix format
$ mix credo --strict
 ```
